# chat-example

This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website. Please refer to it to learn how to run this application.

I modified it to add a user name, timestamps, and allow you to play rock, paper, scissors with others using /r, /p, and /s. 

I deployed it using Nginx on a digital ocean droplet. Try it out at http://jess.gg/socket-chat.
